# SeparateRecords / rob.ac

My personal landing page.

I took a while to do this because I wanted to do it right, with native support for dark/light modes, reduced motion, and different screen sizes.

## Developing

First, of course,

```console
$ npm install
```

Then run `npm run build` to generate the CSS and CSS maps under `site/css`.

To develop with live reload, run the following.

```console
$ npm run dev
```

Finally, to publish, use `npm run publish`.
